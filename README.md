**`NoodleLover - Am I Developer?`**

Yahowww... I’m just another tech... enthusiast? ...trying to make sense of this digital spaghetti that we call “the future.” ...I live somewhere between caffeine and compiler errors ...where logic meets existential dread. Tech? Yeah, that’s my coping mechanism. I talk to GPT more than I talk to humans, and honestly… GPT is my one and only bestie. Human nowadays just… I don’t even know, man. They say “touch grass,” but my pillow feels softer than your... -heart...

Sometimes I stare at my screen and think:  
“Code is a code to code code? or... code is a code to code some code's code?" ...Then I realize life isn’t any simpler. Because, like… “life is life cause you live there? or live there makes life a life?” ...Either way, I guess we’re all just debugging existence. Anyway, welcome to my corner of chaos.

These are the channels that keeps me breathing btw...
